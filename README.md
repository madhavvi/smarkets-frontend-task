# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Instructions
1. On click of event name, it will redirect to event details page.
2. On event deatils page, if refreshed data will not go away as I have used redux-saga to maintain the state.
3. On click of Back button, redirect back to event list.
